## Acknowledgments

* We used this as our motivation to help improve patient’s lives and to remind them for medication. 
 Why do people forget? Because it is easy to forget about the small things.
* We had very little experiences and had to learn from scratch: using APIs, Node.js, and app development.
With limited experience, we took a long time getting everything running up.
Struggled with putting backend together with frontend.
* With Ionic, it can be implemented on web, Android and IOS platforms. 
Using cloud storage, it is possible for medical professionals to access patient’s medicinal history.
